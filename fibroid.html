            </h1>

            <div class="fibroidExplained">
                <p>
                    Fibroids are smooth muscle cells (tumors) made of and fibrous connective tissue that grows in the
                    uterus. They are sometimes called <strong>Uterine Fibroid</strong> for this. It can be thought of
                    as
                    Benign tumor containing fibrous tissue. They are mostly known to appear during childbearing
                    years.
                    Often times, uterus fibroid shows no sign of their presence to the host because most times, they
                    cause no symptoms especially when they are very little in size. It is the most common tumor of
                    the
                    reproductive system and are most often discovered during a routine pelvic exam. There are different
                    sizes associated
                    with fibroid growth,from very tiny seedlings which are
                    not
                    visible to the eyes, to large sizes that can affect the structure and size of the uterus. It can be
                    just one or in any number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In extreme cases, multiple fibroids can expand the uterus so
                    much that it reaches the rib cage and can add weight. The main types of fibroids are:
                    <strong><i>Subserosal</i></strong> which sometimes have a stalk that attaches to the uterus and can
                    grow large, <strong><i>Intramural:</i></strong> which are found in the uterus muscular all, and
                    <strong><i>Submucosal;</i></strong> are very rare, they grow openly and may also include a stalk.
                    Most doctors agrees that fibroids cells are formed as a result of anomalies in a stem cell in
                    the
                    smooth muscular tissue of the uterus (myometrium). This anomaly is when a single cell
                    divides
                    repeatedly continuously until it creates a firm rubbery mass of tissue that is different
                    from
                    the nearby tissue.

                        <p>
                            The causes of Uterine fibroids are still not clearly ascertained, but some lab
                            researches
                            has pointed to some factors such as these;
                        </p>
                        <li> <strong>Changes in human genetics:</strong> A large number of fibroid cells contains
                            genes
                            that are different from the typical uterine muscle cells.</li>
                        <li><strong> Hormones: </strong> A larger quantity of the hormones that causes uterine
                            lining
                            development during menstrual cycle, estrogen and progesterone, are found in fibroid
                            cells.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Age: </strong> A large number of women within the ages 30-45 are especially and
                            up
                            to menopause are often diagnosed with the cases of fibroid. In most cases also, fibroids
                            are
                            less likely to be found at menopause ages and they tend to shrink even when found.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hereditary: </strong>Having history of fibroid in ones family increases the
                            chances
                            of having it. As a lady, if your mother has history with fibroid in her life, then,
                            there is
                            a higher chance of having them yourself.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <p>There are some intentional actions that when taken, can help with the treatment of Fibroids,
                            some of which are listed below.</p>

                        <li><strong>Prevention: </strong>The first conscious action to be taken against any anomaly
                            is
                            to prevent it from occuring in the first place. Although, preventing fibroid many not be
                            completely possible yet its chances of occurence can be greatly reduced by maintaining
                            healthy weight, eating fruits and vegetables, and exercise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Watchful Waiting: </strong> Since fibroids are not cancerous, have slow growth,
                            rarely interfere with pregnancy and shrinks after menopause, this remedy could be the
                            best
                            procedure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medication: </strong> Hormones that are associated with menstrualcycle
                            regulation
                            are usually the focus of uterine fibroid medications. They usually provide relief for
