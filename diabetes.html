                        Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough
                        hormone that regulates blood sugar or when the body cannot effectively use the hormones
                        produced by the pancreas. These two reasons gave rise to the two major types of diabetes: the
                        <strong><i>Type 1; </i></strong>the pancreas produces no or very low quantity of this
                        hormone, the <strong><i>Type 2: </i></strong> the pancreas produces the necessary hormones
                        but the body cannot make use of these hormones. These results in the build up of extra sugar in
                        your bloodstream. With a build up of extra or excess sugar in the bloodstream, one is at the
                        dangers of having serious complications which may result in unpalatable consequences. Another
                        type of diabetes is <strong>Gestational diabetes </strong>which is liable to develop during
                        pregnancy.
                        <strong>Hyperglycemia,</strong> or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled
                        diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the
                        nerves and blood vessels.
