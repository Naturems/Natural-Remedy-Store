                    <p>
                        The human eye is an oval shaped organ or globe, which is between half an inch and can sometimes
                        grow a little above an inch in diameter, and enables us to see. It is simply an organ of sight.
                        Defective vision is the usual health problem almost all the people are suffering from nowadays
                        in one way or other. Along with other important body parts, our eyes also play a Vital Role in
                        describing our Personality and Confidence. Suffering from eye defect may also sometimes lead to
                        lack of Self Confidence.

                        Of course, who loves wearing glasses at a growing age? None, and to hide the defect, people
                        prefer using lenses instead of spectacles. You should consider your eyesight as one of your most
                        valuable organ in your body, and maintaining its health should be of great concern to you. But,
                        have you ever thought deeply about your eye defect? Do you know about the factors leading to
                        defective eye? There are three fundamental types of eye problems.Below are lists of common
                        problems associated with the human eye.

                        <strong>CATARACTS:</strong> This condition is characterized by its cloudy vision. The eye seems
                        to be covered by a milky white cloud. It is a condition that is very common with people of ages
                        from 45 years and above, and can be of any gender. The main symptom is blurry vision. This is
                        like looking through a cloudy or milky colored window. Cataracts can be caused by direct or
                        indirect injury to the eye, exposure to too much light, or the reduction of protein in the body
                        over time. <strong>Treatments:</strong> Use of corrective Lens, Surgery, and Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>HYPERMOPIA:</strong> This condition is commonly referred to as "farsightedness". This
                        condition reduce the ability to focus on near objects. It is an abnormal condition in which
                        visions for distant objects are better than near objects. If reading close up materials becomes
                        blury and are only better read distanced away from the eye, then you can be said to be
                        farsighted. Often times, farsightedness is caused by a cornea that is not curved enough. This
                        condition can be inherited from parents. <strong>Treatments:</strong> Use of corrective Lens,
                        Surgery, and Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>ASTIGMATISM:</strong> This is a defect in an optical system in which light rays from a
                        single point fail to converge in a single focal point. This is a problem that is caused by the
                        curve of your cornea. If you have it, your eye can’t focus light onto the retina the way it
                        should. In this case, all the light rays don’t come on the single focus point of retina. Some
                        rays fall on retina while the others fall in front of retina or behind it. In this type of eye
                        defect, you will not be able to see anything clearly. <strong>Treatments:</strong> Corrective
                        lenses, Laser Surgery, and Supplement.

                    <p>
                        <strong>DRY-EYES:</strong> This is a condition in which the tear gland produces little or
                        quantity of tears which then result in low humidity of the eyes. This condition is a very rare
                        and critical condition but it can be treated and corrected if reported to an ophthalmologist on
                        time. Some symptoms associated with this condition include but not limited to burning, itching,
                        frequent blinking of the eye-lid, and so on. Dry-eyes can be very uncomfortable.
                        <strong>Treatments:</strong> Eye drops, Surgery, and Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>MYOPIA:</strong> This condition is commonly referred to as "nearsightedness". It is an
                        abnormality resulting from the eye's faulty refractive ability; distant objects appear blurred.
                        This condition reduce the ability to focus on far objects. It is an abnormal condition in which
                        visions for close objects are better than far objects. If reading or focusing on far away
                        materials or objects becomes blury and are only better read close up to the eye, then you can be
                        said to be nearsighted. <strong>Treatments:</strong> Use of corrective Lens, Surgery, and
                        Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>PRESBYOPIA:</strong> This condition is often mistaken for farsightedness but are of
                        distinct causes and slightly similar symptom. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of the ability to
                        clearly see close objects or small print due to aging of the eyes. It occurs when the eye
                        natural lens loses flexibility, while the natural shape of the eyeball is a factor for
                        farsightedness occurence, and it causes light rays entering into the eye to bend incorrectly
                        once they have entered the eye.<strong>Treatments:</strong> Corrective lenses, refractive
                        Surgery, and Supplement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>TEARING:</strong> This is the exact opposite of dry-eyes condition of the eyes. In this
                        condition, the tear gland produces too much quantity of tears resulting to free or quick running
                        of tears out of the eyes with little or no cause. This condition is mostly caused by too much
                        sensitivity of the eyes to change to either light, temperature, wind, and touch. Eye infections
                        may also be a major cause to tearing. <strong>Treatments:</strong> Lenses (to help reduce wind,
                        touches, and light), Surgery, and Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>FLOATERS:</strong> This condition is commonly known with people with ages varying from
                        50 years and above. The term floater is gotten from the symptom of the condition itself as tiny
                        spots or specks floats across the field of vision of an individual. These specks are formed from
                        the deposit of protein floating about in the anterior chamber of the eyes. This specks do not
                        block vision, only floats around in the eyes. <strong>Treatments:</strong> Surgery, and
                        Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>ABERRATIONS:</strong> This condition is sometimes called Higher-order Vision Defects: a
                        synonym for error. In this condition, light rays are focused mistakenly so that they don’t form
                        a clear picture. Aberration are noticeable at night, and light reaches the retina with less
                        focus. Under these conditions, vision can become much worse and/or the individual is more
                        susceptible to glare.<strong>Treatments:</strong> Laser Surgery, and Supplement.

                            Defect around a month ago and went to do an eye test just this morning. My optician really
                            couldn’t believe it! He was so surprised with my improvement that he said that he never saw
                            anything like it. (Not without surgery at least!) I gave him your website address and he
                            said that he is going to check it out and try it himself. Thank you for making this

                            I have been suffering from short-sightness since a very young age. I was considering laser

                    <p>
                        This Natural Herbal Supplement is helping thousands of Men and Women to see Clearly and Better
                        without the need for their corrective lenses. Some of them literally throw away their glasses
                        after a short while because it became of no use again to them. If you are suffering from any of
                        the above eye conditions, then you would benefit
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        from what I have to show you. Whether you are wearing glasses already or your eyesight is
                        getting worse and you think you may need glasses now or in the future. Information is power and
                        can be more powerful than medicine at times, but it's only if you really make use of it. To
                        every problem, there is always a solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nothing is more painful than a missed privilege that brings healing and freedom from series of
                        health challenges. Your eyes defect is a wake-up call for you to discover a new insight that
                        will add to your wealth of knowledge and walk you out of any of the above eyes defects.
