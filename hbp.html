                <p>
                    When a doctor talks about measuring a patient's blood pressure, the doctor simply wants to
                    measure the force that the movement of blood exerts on the walls of the arteries as it flows
                    through them. The arteries carries blood from the heart to other parts of the body. A person's
                    blood pressure can be determined by the amount of blood his heart pumps and the amount of
                    resistance to blood flow in your arteries. When a patient is diagnosed of <strong>High Blood
                        Pressure</strong>, it simply means that the rate at which your heart pumps blood and the
                    force of which these blood flows through the arteries is high. In other words, the patient will
                    be

                <p>
                    said to have <strong>Hypertension</strong>, which is a common name given to this condition.
                    Blood pressure readings are measured using two different ways: the first is the systolic blood
                    pressure, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. The second is the
                    diastolic blood pressure which measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests
                    between beats. If systolic reads 120, and diastolic reads 80 then the reading will be said to be
                    “120 over 80,” or written as, “120/80 mmHg.” When blood pressure measures above the normal
                    readings, then a patient is said to be Hypertensive.

            <div class="hbpCauses">
                <p>
                    High Blood Pressure does not have specific cause that prompts it's occurence, but certain
                    factors increases the chances of being diagnosed with this condition. The best way to know if
                    you have high blood pressure is to regularly check your pressure with your consultant. Note:
                    there are two types of High blood pressures (Primary and Secondary), and they have distinct
                    causes or risk factors that are associated with them. The primary condition gradually develops
                    over time, while the secondary condition develops suddenly.
